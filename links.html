        <h1>Links</h1>

        <p>This is an example about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>

        <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

        <ul>
            <!-- Add <li> elements here -->
            
            <!-- best to reserve for directing users to a different website -->
            <li>Absolute links, like to
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" 
                target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very 
                good resource for web developers.
            </li>
            
            <!-- point to another file in your website -->
            <!-- let you move around entire folders without having to update all href's -->
            <li>Relative links, like to our <a href="misc/extras.html">extras page</a>.
            </li>
            
            <!-- links relative to the root of the entire website -->
            <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href="/">home page</a> of our website, 
                but those are not useful to us right now.
            </li>
        </ul>
